          <h3>DO WE NEED A USA PASSPORT?</h3>
          <p>YES. You&acute;ll need it to get a Mexican visa and get back to USA.</p>

          <h3>HOW TO GET TO EL OVIACHIC LAKE?</h3>
          <p>El Oviachic lake is 25 miles north of Cd Obregon, Sonora, Mexico, the city where we will be accommodated to go fishing.</p>
          <p>The distance between Nogales and Cd. Obregon is 328 miles, Highway 15.</p>
          <p>If you are driving, you&apos;ll have to get car permits and visa at km 21 office. You can get the car permit online also at banjercito.com but you&apos;ll have to stop on the 21 km to get the visa. Car permit is $50.00 USD.</p>
          <p>Cd Obregon has an International Airport also Airport code: CEN). You can fly down here, just ask Aeromexico and a round trip Phoenix-Obregon cost around $900.00 USD. or to nearby city Hermosillo (airport code: HMO), ~$550.00usd and then take the bus right at the airport to Ciudad Obregon.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Just spoke to TUFESA BUS LINE USA general manager Arturo Monje,</p>
          <p>he told me that a round trip Phoenix- Obregon ( where i am picking you up) is just $178.00 USD, that is a special bus that only have 3 seats per row and is a 11 hrs trip.</p>
          <p>Also he says that you can bring 3 bags, clothes, tackle and rods on the bus, the bus is going to stop at the crossing line USA- Mexico to check the bags of the passangers and american citizens have to get a permit to get in to mexico ( please to tell the driver ) it&apos;s free for less than 7 days. He is a close friend of mine and told me if you want more info to e mail him at arturomonje@hotmail.com he knows all the answers to get here.<br />
          </p>
          <br />
